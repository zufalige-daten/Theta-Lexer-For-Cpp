# Theta Lexer For Cpp
 A lexer called 'Theta' as a small c++ header you can include and use to lex some code in a compiler, transpiler, assembler, etc. Support right now is not full, python lexing won't work due to indentation, but other than that, most languages that don't use indentation as a core part of the language can be lexed.
